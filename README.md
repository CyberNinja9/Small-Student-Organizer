# Small Student Organizer

The Small Student Organizer  is a Windows Forms application developed in C#. This application allows users to manage student information, including adding new students and viewing student details by class.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Users can add new students to the system. Each student must have a name, last name, class, and ID. The class of the student is selected from a predefined list.
- **View Students by Class**: Users can view all students' IDs for a selected class. The class selection is done via a combo box.
- **View Student Details**: Users can view details of a specific student by selecting their ID from the list box. The details are displayed in labels.
- **Non-Resizable Forms**: The forms in the application are not resizable to ensure a consistent user experience.

## Technical Details

- **Dictionary Storage**: All student data is stored in a dictionary, where the key is the class of the student and the value is a list of student objects.
- **Encapsulation**: All fields in the `Student` class are encapsulated to adhere to good programming practices.
- **Event Handling**: The application uses event handling for updating the display based on user interactions, such as changing the selected class or student ID.
